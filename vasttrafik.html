            Project Overview</h2>
            
            <p>Västtrafik is the provider of public transportation in the city of Göteborg and “Reseplaneraren” is their in-app 
                solution where citizens can plan their travels, buy tickets and view general information. The app is already widely used and solidified within Västtrafik.
                This project stretches through the entire process of Design Thinking and as students we had to find improvement points in the application and apply UI solutions 
                to a specific demographic based on User Research. </p>

            Design Process</h2>
        <p>The Design Thinking model contains 5 stages: Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test. 
            The process is iterative and stages can be repeated through out the project. </p>

            <p>With the data gathered and compiled we chose a demographic to focus on and created a persona as a baseline for
                 further User Research. The UX persona was a great tool for building empathy and keeping the user behaviour, motivation 
                 and goals in the center.</p>

            <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
            <p>Scenarios were then formed based on the needs and struggles of the persona and after that live tested on real users. 
                This is where we found and could define the actual problems in the user experience.</p>

            <p>We started by looking at other public transportation-apps for other cities 
                to see if they have constructed their user flow different which was a great 
                way to find initial ideas to implement in our own train of thought.</p>

            <h3>Brainstorming and Workshop</h3>
            <p>With the competitor analysis fresh in mind we sat down as a team and started to brainstorm on how to solve the three main 
                issues our User Research resulted in. We used a method called “Crazy 8” to draw out our ideas and later voted on what ideas 
                to go further with and expand more on in our Wireframes.</p>

            <h3>Solidifying our ideas</h3>
            <p>The team used Trello to structure sprints and workflow on the prototype, planning out the entire timeframe of what needed to be 
                done to meet the deadline. The first sprint was to create mid-fidelity wireframes and test them on users to verify that our solutions 
                actually made sense and worked on a fundamental level.</p>

           <p>User feedback and data from tests verified that the user experience had been improved by our implementations. With this concluded we embarked 
            on our next sprint which was to convert our mid-fi wireframes into an hi-fi prototype ready for presentation.</p>

            <h3>High Fidelity</h3>
            <p>Since the app already is in use by the public today the assets and colour themes were already set, we just had to build our own iPhone 14 1:1 component 
                library and prototype it in Figma. A massive task but with a very satisfying end result.</p>

            <h3>Västtrafik reseplaneraren & ToGo</h3>
            <p>This was a large project stretching over 5 months and really layed the foundation of not only the Design Thinking model and User Research but UX as a whole.
                It served as an introduction to gathering data from users and turning that data into a visible change for the better. Furthermore it helped me 
                improve my skills in:</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>Figma</li>
                 <li>Structuring agile workflows in Trello</li>
                 <li>Working in a team with varying skills and needs</li>
                 <li>Understanding the communication between organizational teams and stakeholders</li>
                </ul>

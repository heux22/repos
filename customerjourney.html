        <p>We want to base our customer journey map on the avarage customer and for this a UX persona combined with ethnographic studies are excellent because it gives us both quantative and qualitative data to work with.</p>

        <h2>Insights and what I've learned</h2>
        <p>The challenge in this project was doing the ethnographic studies. Finding and following a user around in real time where anything could happen  turned to be really fun and eye-opening to how different 
            our choices and motivations are. Though it was hard to capture everything on film the team did a great job to then transcribe and compile all the data into one customer journey.</p>

                        <p class="p-padding">Småtrollen is a parent cooperative preschool located in Göteborg. Their website was very outdated and in dire need of a new design to attract new members to join the coopeative.
                            This project was mobile first and stretched over 2 weeks. Representatives from Småtrollen shared their conceptual views of what they were looking for in their new website and colour 
                            themes as well as other content. They also presented us with examples of websites that could serve as inspiration.</p>

                    <h3>Competitor Analysis and Heuristics</h3>
                    <p>In the meeting with Småtrollen they shared examples of two other websites that had designs that they liked. 
                        After a competitor analysis of the websites it was clearer what type of design they had in mind. A clean and basic site with modern menus and navigation.
                        The heuristics we chose to evaluate Småtrollens old site with are two from Jacob Nielsen and NNgroups list.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design - Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed.</li>
                        <li>Recognition rather than recall - The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another.</li>

                        <li>Low contrast between text and background.</li>
                        <li>Dropdown menus lacked indication that it in fact was a dropdown menu.</li>

                    <h3>Re-categorizing information</h3>
                    <p>We used a method called card sorting to structure all the textual information that was present on the website. This was a great way to se 
                        what text was redundant, what could be shortened down and what could be removed. This also helped us categorize the information into broader 
                        and more relevant topics and make navigation easier for the users.</p>

                <p>With the information arcitecture done the team used a method called Crazy 8 to ideate a design sketch for each page and topic. The best sketches that represented our heuristics 
                    were chosen to proceed into prototype. Based on the sketches tasks were added to Trello to create all the necessary components in Figma.</p>

                    <p>When building our prototype we set bootstrap grid at a standard of 12 colums and used box layout so each member could work with their tasks and still have the same measurements 
                        through out the site. This also helps developers to build when converting to actual code.</p>
